## YoYos: Analysining data from microstructures DAT009 -> ...
_Bela_
Using micorider to look at the mixing coefficients chi and epsilon and see how they change with time and how this effects isotherms

### 1. Process DAT009-DAT018 .P files to .nc files 
use Bec's MATLAB code to process .P files to get spectra data and save as a .csv or .nc file ????

Paper which explains method of code:
Comparison of Turbulence Intensity from CTD-Attached and Free-Fall Microstructure Profilers
